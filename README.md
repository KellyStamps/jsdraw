Highlights of the Project:

1. Drawings are like HTML elements, can be dragged and below html actions can still be persisted
2. In case of zooming of the drawing and dragging, no need to redraw again and again, which it would have been otherwise in case of canvas

Priority list:
1. download option or browser print option
2. compare performance with canvas board beside
    - achieve above mentioned highlights in implemented freeformDrawing
    - use paperjs or any other canvas library to achieve above mentioned highlights
3. Write comparison in words and instructions to test
4. build process to obfuscate code
5. copy paste option
6. binding events option

Applications:
1. drawing library on blogs
2. chrome plugin
3. code-free game development

1. basic drawing board
2. download drawn things option

Step I:
1. on button click, draw freeform enable
2. draw freeform in a paintbox/defined rectangle
3. make components draggable and resizeable and restructurable
4. save as jpeg
5. copy paste components

To Do items:

1. draw on user actions
2. fetch rectangular components
3. write actions to components
4. compare performance with html5 canvas
5. build different 2D apps
6. state limitations are to 2D as pixels are not treated as individuals
