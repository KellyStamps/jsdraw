Highlights of the Project:

1. Drawings are like HTML elements, can be dragged and below html actions can still be persisted
2. In case of zooming of the drawing and dragging, no need to redraw again and again, which it would have been otherwise in case of canvas

To Do items:

1. draw on user actions
2. fetch rectangular components
3. write actions to components
4. compare performance with html5 canvas
5. build different 2D apps
6. state limitations are to 2D as pixels are not treated as individuals

Step I:
1. on button click, draw freeform enable
2. draw freeform in a paintbox/defined rectangle
3. make components draggable and resizeable and restructurable
4. save as jpeg
5. copy paste components

1. basic drawing board
2. download drawn things option
